# Training Results Analysis

## Model Training Performance

The model was trained for 3 epochs on a dataset of 5221 samples from the Wikitext-2 corpus. Here are the key metrics from the training run:

### Loss Progress
- Initial loss at start of epoch 1: ~10.94
- Loss at end of epoch 1: ~8.85
- Loss at end of epoch 2: ~7.71
- Final loss at end of epoch 3: ~7.00

### Perplexity
- Final evaluation perplexity: 1277.93

### Training Time
- Total training time: ~90 seconds for 3 epochs

## Text Generation Results

The model demonstrates basic text generation capabilities, though the output is still somewhat incoherent due to limited training data and time. Some patterns observed:

1. The model has learned basic sentence structure with articles, prepositions, and punctuation
2. It generates some numeric values (million, percentages)
3. There are still many placeholder-like tokens (@@ symbols)
4. The model struggles with maintaining coherent context 

## Improvement Suggestions

1. **Extended Training**: The loss was still decreasing at the end of training, suggesting more epochs would improve results
2. **Larger Dataset**: Training on more data like the full Wikitext-103 would enhance performance
3. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Experimenting with learning rate, batch size, and model size 
4. **Longer Context**: Increasing sequence length for better coherence
5. **More Compute**: Training with multiple GPUs for larger model sizes
