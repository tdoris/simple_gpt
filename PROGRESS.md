# SimpleGPT Project Progress

## Overview
Successfully implemented a transformer-based language model training system from scratch. The project provides educational implementations of both encoder-decoder transformers and decoder-only GPT-style models.

## Accomplishments

### Architecture Implementation
- Built a modular, extensible codebase with clean separation of concerns
- Implemented multi-head attention mechanisms, feed-forward networks, and positional encoding
- Created both full encoder-decoder transformer and GPT-style decoder-only models
- Added text generation capabilities with temperature and top-k/top-p sampling

### Training Framework
- Created a flexible trainer with support for:
  - Mixed precision training
  - Gradient accumulation
  - Learning rate scheduling
  - Checkpoint saving and loading
  - Optional Weights & Biases integration

### Data Processing
- Implemented a BPE tokenizer with vocabulary handling
- Built dataset processing for efficient training
- Added support for HuggingFace datasets integration
- Included data collation with proper padding

### Testing & Documentation
- Added unit tests for core components
- Created detailed documentation in README.md
- Provided command-line tools for ease of use

## Training Results
Successfully trained a small model on the Wikitext-2 dataset with observable loss reduction. The model is capable of generating text, though more training would be needed for better quality.

## Next Steps
- Fine-tune hyperparameters for better performance
- Implement model parallel training for larger models
- Add more robust evaluation metrics
- Create a web demo for text generation
